for now we can just keep the notevim like you currently do at work
just have one for personal use.


note > task > reminder
paragraph + action + timestamp



let's model constraints somehow
we may want a DSL for the rules

rules operate on time objects, time ranges, days of week, hours, minutes, seconds, dates,
what are the "verbs" that operate on them?
nouns are like Tasks and description
is there a way to hash these entities?


list the tasks and suggest one, like google now cards ish
